Lurgle.Transfer is an implementation of SSH.NET, FluentFTP, and SMBLibrary that accelerates getting your project up and running with file transfers. It includes added features such as GZIP/ZIP compression, and file archival.

The net effect is a predictable file transfer implementation that can be integrated into your project and used to inform logging and alerting.

You can use Lurgle.Transfer by itself, or with [Lurgle.Logging](https://github.com/MattMofDoom/Lurgle.Logging) and [Lurgle.Alerting](https://github.com/MattMofDoom/Lurgle.Alerting) to Lurgle your apps even further with standardised Serilog and FluentEmail implementations, and [Lurgle.Dates](https://github.com/MattMofDoom/Lurgle.Dates) for useful date handling functions including a C# implementation of Abstract API's [Holidays API](https://www.abstractapi.com/holidays-api)!
